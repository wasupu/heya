heya
======

_Heya (sumo) from the Japanese word for "room" (部屋)_

Heya is the first step in a log roadmap describes in the project wiki, the project consist in create a simulation of one autonomous robot that live in a plain, no obstacles, walled environment.

The project is developed using [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). The main reason use [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) is mainly the actors system built in the language that permits the simulation of the physical robots.

The virtual robot target is visit all points of its square plain world and transmit the information to an external observer. 

The only information that can use the robot to reach this mission is it on board sensor information.

The robot in this first step don't have any energy restriction.

Other restriction of this project is the resulting virtual robot can be constructed using [lego mindstorm](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/?domainredir=mindstorms.lego.com). Why? when this phase are reached the resulting robot will be prototyped easily using this technology.
