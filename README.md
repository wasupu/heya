heya
======

_Heya (sumo) from the Japanese word for "room" (部屋)_

Heya is the first step in a log roadmap describes in the project wiki, the project consist in create a simulation of one autonomous robot that live in a plain, no obstacles, walled environment.

The project is developed using [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). The main reason use [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) is mainly the actors system built in the language that permits the simulation of the physical robots.

Other restriction of this project is the resulting virtual robot can be constructed using [lego mindstorm](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/?domainredir=mindstorms.lego.com). Why? when this phase are reached the resulting robot will be prototyped easily using this technology.
